# Control flow and loops

This repository includes tasks and exercises on control flow and loops in Python. It focuses on using conditional statements and loops to control the logic and flow of Python programs.

## What This Repository Covers

- **Conditional Statements**:
  - **`if`, `elif`, `else`**: Understanding how to use conditional branches
  - **Nested Conditions**: Using conditions within conditions for complex logic
  - **Logical Operators**: Combining conditions with `and`, `or`, and `not`
- **Loops**:
  - **For Loops**: Iterating over sequences (like lists, tuples, and strings)
  - **While Loops**: Looping based on a condition until itâ€™s no longer true
  - **Nested Loops**: Loops within loops for working with multidimensional data
  - **Loop Control Statements**:
    - **`break`**: Exiting a loop early
    - **`continue`**: Skipping the current iteration and continuing with the next
    - **`pass`**: Placeholder for future code, used to define empty loops or conditions
- **Practical Applications**:
  - Basic iterations for lists, dictionaries, and strings
  - Generating sequences and performing calculations within loops
  - Common control flow patterns for problem-solving
