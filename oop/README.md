# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

This repository contains code, exercises focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It covers the principles of OOP and demonstrates how to structure and organize code in a modular, reusable, and scalable way.

## What This Repository Covers

### Core OOP Concepts
- **Classes and Objects**:
  - Defining classes and creating objects
  - Using attributes (instance and class variables) and methods
- **Encapsulation**:
  - Access control with private and public attributes
  - Getter and setter methods for controlled data access
- **Inheritance**:
  - Creating subclasses and inheriting from parent classes
  - Method overriding and extending functionality
  - Using `super()` for parent class method access
- **Polymorphism**:
  - Method overloading and overriding
  - Polymorphic behavior across different object types
- **Abstraction**:
  - Abstract classes and methods (using `abc` module)
  - Hiding implementation details to simplify interfaces

### Practical Applications
- **Real-World Examples**: Implementing OOP concepts in projects, such as a basic banking system, inventory management, and user management
- **Design Patterns**: Introduction to common OOP design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer
